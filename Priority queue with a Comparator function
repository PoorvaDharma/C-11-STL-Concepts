By default Priority queue is sorted in decreasing order. If a different order is needed a comparator predecate is to defined.

ex  priority_queue<ListNode *, vector<ListNode *>, comp> pq;

struct comp
{
    bool operator() (const ListNode *p,const ListNode *q)
    {
        return p.val>q.val;
    }
}

The comparator operator fills the container in reverse order, in this case the largest element is placed at last.
