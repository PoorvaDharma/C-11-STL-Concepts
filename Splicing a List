The list::splice() is a built-in function in C++ STL which is used to transfer elements from one list to another. 
The splice() function can be used in three ways:

1. Transfer all the elements of list x into another list at some position.
2. Transfer only the element pointed by i from list x into the list at some position.
3. Transfers the range [first, last) from list x into another list at some position.


list1.splice (iterator position List1, list2)
                or 
list1.splice (iterator position List1, list2, iterator of list2)
                or 
list1.splice (iterator position List1, list2, iterator first of list2, iterator last of list2)


#This can be used to splice a single list also like so

  l1.splice(l.begin(),l1,it(to some element in l1))
 
 removes an element from position it and adds it to the begining.
